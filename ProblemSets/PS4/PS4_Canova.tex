\section{Part 1}
I am working to collect data on family business creation.  By this, I mean that I would like to access records of business ownership transfer.  The records are government records and are public information.  I have yet to find a suitable website for scraping or an API in which I can access this data yet.  If such a suitable website is not found, I will proceed to scrap LinkedIn for anyone with the key word "Professional Referee" on their profile.

\section{Assignments in R}

\subsection{JSON Files Part 1}
The answer to question 5 part d is that the data are characters.

\subsection{Sparklyr Part 2}
I was unable to get spark and sparklyr to compute successfully.
