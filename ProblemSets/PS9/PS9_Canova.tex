\maketitle

\section{LASSO}
\subsection{What is the optimal value of $\lambda$?}
0.0233

\subsection{What is the in-sample RMSE?}
0.187

\subsection{What is the out-of-sample RMSE (i.e. the RMSE in the test data)?]}
0.149


\section{Ridge Model}
\subsection{What is the optimal value of $\lambda$ now?}
0.0000000001

\subsection{What is the out-of-sample RMSE (i.e. the RMSE in the test data)?}
0.157

\section{Additional Questions}
\subsection{Would you be able to estimate a simple linear regression model on a data set that had more columns than rows?}

Given the high dimensionality of such a scenario, an overfitting of an equation would ensue and thus transition a linear model into an exponential model.


\subsection{Bias-Variance Tradeoff}
Judging by the lower out-of-sample RMSE of the two (Ridge), I would suppose that the Ridge is the better model in terms of the bias-variance trade-off.
